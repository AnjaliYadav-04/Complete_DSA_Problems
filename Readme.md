# 📘 DSA Practice with Python

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
This repo contains Python solutions to problems I’m solving while learning core DSA concepts and improving problem-solving skills.

## ✅ Topics Covered (So Far)

- 🔢 **Basic Math Concepts**
- 🧩 **Pattern Printing**
- 🔐 **Hashing**
- 🔄 **Recursion**

📌 *More topics (Arrays, Strings, Trees, DP) will be added soon.*

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.  
From the terminal (inside the `DSA/` folder), run:

```bash
python folder_name/filename.py
```

### ▶️ Example Commands
```bash
# Patterns
python patterns/patern1.py

# Recursion
python recursion/basics.py

# I/O Batch Script (Windows)
cd recursion && run_python_io.bat
```
### 🎯 Learning Goals
- [ ] Practice 3-5 DSA problems per week  
- [x] Build logic through pattern/recursion practice
- [x] Strengthen fundamentals for coding interviews and tech assessments

📌 Notes
input.txt and output.txt in the recursion/ folder are used for test input/output.

Code is written in Python 3.x, using VS Code editor.

Each problem is saved by concept or topic.
