# 📘 DSA Practice with Python

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice repository!  
This repo contains Python solutions to problems I’m solving while learning core DSA concepts and improving problem-solving skills.

## ✅ Topics Covered (So Far)

- 🔢 **Basic Math Concepts**
- 🧩 **Pattern Printing**
- 🔐 **Hashing**
- 🔄 **Recursion**

📌 *More topics (Arrays, Strings, Trees, DP) will be added soon.*

---

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

From the terminal (inside the `DSA/` folder), run:

```bash
python folder_name/filename.py

🔁 Example Commands
bash
Copy
Edit
python patterns/patern1.py
python recursion/basics.py

🎯 Learning Goals
Practice 3–5 DSA problems per week
Build logic through pattern and recursion problems
Strengthen fundamentals for coding interviews and tech assessments

📌 Notes
input.txt and output.txt in the recursion/ folder are used for test input/output.
Code is written in Python 3.x, using VS Code editor.
Each problem is saved by concept or topic.
